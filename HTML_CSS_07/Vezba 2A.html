				<p>As a result of the recent changes to legal party combinations, we sometimes have scenarios where three person parties have a lot of trouble finding compatible players. This is because 3 person parties have recently been disallowed from matching against 5 stacks or solos. Matching against solos in particular had allowed for a much bigger spectrum of compatible matches, but we know that that is undesirable to some players. So with this update, we are allowing 2s and 3s to on occasion match with a 5 stack when the need is high.</p>
				<p>Immortal players can now only party with Immortal or Divine players in Ranked. Immortal players will only ever be matched with other Immortal or Divine players in Ranked. This means, for example, that if there is a Divine player in a party with players below Divine, that divine player will as a result never end up in a match with other Immortal players.</p>
